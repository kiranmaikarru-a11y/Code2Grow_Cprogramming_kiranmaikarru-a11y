The main function will handle the overall program flow. It will declare variables for the total number of passengers, total revenue, highest fare, lowest fare, and their corresponding names. It will then prompt the user for the total number of passengers and use a for loop to process each passenger's details.
Inside the loop, the program will prompt for each passenger's name, age, distance, and time of travel. It will then calculate the base fare and apply discounts and surcharges based on the rules provided.
