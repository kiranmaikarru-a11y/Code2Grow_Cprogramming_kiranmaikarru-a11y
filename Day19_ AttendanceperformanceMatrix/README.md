Input Phase: Gathers student names, attendance (1s/0s), and marks (0-100) using nested for loops. Processing Phase: Calculates total attendance, total marks, averages, and identifies top/bottom performers using if statements and loops. Menu System: A do-while loop presents a menu with various options, handled by a switch statement. Users can choose to display raw data matrices or detailed reports. Grades (A-F) are assigned in the reports using if-else if logic based on average marks. The code runs interactively in the console and strictly avoids functions, structures, and pointers.
