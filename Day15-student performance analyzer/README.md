The main function is the entry point. Variables are declared to store the number of students, their marks, and the calculated statistics
The program prompts the user for the number of students, ensuring it is within the valid range (1 to 10). It then uses a for loop to input the marks for each student and stores them in the marks array.
A single for loop iterates through the marks array to perform all necessary calculations. It updates the sum, finds the highest and lowest marks, counts passed/failed students, and tallies the grade distribution based on the specified criteria.
The average is calculated using the total sum and the number of students. The program then prints a summary of all the calculated statistics in a structured format
